Islands are classified based on the generally-held belief surrounding their place in the Oceansky.

Isolation Class - This culture believes themselves to be the only one in the world. This is most often paired with an ignorance for the Oceansky's existence, and the sea and sky are believed to be two separate planes with no reason to believe anything otherwise.

Mythos Class - There is deep-held mythology present in the culture suggesting that other cultures or islands might exist, but few actually hold to it as a scientific belief. A "who knows/who cares?" philosophy is applied to the idea of the Oceansky, as some believe it to be an inverted sphere and some believe them to be separate plans.

Trust Class - Most believe in the Oceansky and the presence of other cultures and islands, but there has been no reported history to prove it for sure. However, the possibility is always there and general society would not be surprised if another civilization was found or made contact. There is very little separation in language or thought between the ocean and the sky.

Commerce Class - This island is close enough to another to view it on the horizon or closer and has established trade, truce, or some other agreement with another civilization (if there is one on the nearby island). If the nearby island drifts over the horizon eventually, Commerce Class is maintained for as long as the general population still has the other civilization in recent memory and believes this history to be true. These cultures are very rare and see absolutely no separation between sea and sky.
